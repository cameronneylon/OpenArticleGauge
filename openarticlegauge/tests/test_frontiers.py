# a list of file paths and the expected licence object from parsing that file path
#
# in the examples here we construct file paths that are relative to this test class
# in the "resources" sub-directory.  If you put your test documents in there, then
# all you need to change is the filename, which is the final argument passed os.path.join
#
# the example file used resources/pbio1001406.html is a Frontiers web page
#
# The licence object is as defined in the OAG API documentation.  Any fields omitted will
# not be checked.  Any fields included will be checked for an exact match against the actual
# record received when the plugin is run.  See below for the full spec of the licence
# object.
#
# The rules for the comparison licence object are:
# - if a key has a value, there resulting object's value must match exactly
# - if a key has been omitted, it will not be tested
# - if a key's value is the empty string, the resulting object's key's value must be the empty string
# - if a key's value is None, the resulting object MUST NOT have the key or MUST be the empty string
# - if a key's value is -1, the resulting object MUST have the key
